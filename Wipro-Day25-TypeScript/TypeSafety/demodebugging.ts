//We can perform debugging in TypeScript using various tools and techniques. One of the most popular tools for debugging TypeScript is Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which provides built-in support for TypeScript debugging.
// To debug TypeScript code in VS Code, you can follow these steps:
// 1. Set up a launch configuration: In VS Code, you need to create a launch configuration that specifies how to run and debug your TypeScript code. You can do this by creating a `launch.json` file in the `.vscode` directory of your project. This file will contain the necessary configurations for debugging your TypeScript code.
// 2. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript: Before you can debug your TypeScript code, you need to compile it to JavaScript. You can do this using the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) or by using a build tool like Webpack or Gulp.
// 3. Set breakpoints: Once you have your launch configuration set up and your TypeScript code compiled, you can set breakpoints in your TypeScript files. Breakpoints allow you to pause the execution of your code at specific lines, so you can inspect variables and understand the flow of your program.
        // inspect variables and understand the flow of your program. You can set breakpoints by clicking in the gutter next to the line numbers in your TypeScript files.
        // Step through your code: When you start debugging, you can step through your code line by line to see how it executes. This allows you to identify any issues or bugs in your TypeScript code and understand how different parts of your program interact with each other.
  // Catch runtime errors: If your TypeScript code throws an error during execution, the debugger will pause at the point where the error occurred, allowing you to inspect the state of your application and identify the cause of the error.
// 4. Start debugging: With everything set up, you can start debugging your TypeScript code by launching the debugger in VS Code. This will run your code and pause at any breakpoints you have set, allowing you to step through your code, inspect variables, and identify any issues.
// 5. Use the Debug Console: While debugging, you can use the Debug Console in VS Code to evaluate expressions, inspect variables, and execute commands. This can help you understand the state of your application and identify any issues.
// Overall, debugging TypeScript in VS Code is a powerful way to identify and fix issues in your code, and it provides a seamless experience for TypeScript developers. With the right setup and tools, you can efficiently debug your TypeScript code and ensure that your applications run smoothly.
